                    <p>Community Justice League is a mission-focused volunteer-driven initiative to strengthen our neighbourhoods and build community resilience through restorative justice practices. We are neighbours helping our neighbours in dialogue and healing through community mediation circles.</p>
                    
                    <p>We engage with individuals in various stages of the criminal justice system and offer them mentorship and supports in order to connect, build roots, and find purpose. Because reintegration doesn't work when individuals were never integrated into their communities to begin with.</p>
                    
                    <p>We believe everyone is capable of growth and positive change such that we can reach our full potential, when given the right environment and support. Aside from providing mentors exemplifying model behaviour we will also look for apprenticeship opportunities in our community when appropriate.</p>
                    
                    <p>With a referral we will also help victims and those they have offended reconcile and find common ground. We endeavour to provide legal services to our neighbours experiencing difficulties in the criminal justice system, where appropriate.</p>

So then you kind of try to piece it back together, and with the needle and thread as you were to kind of allow the fabric of community be strengthen but it's not pretty; it's not like it was before… you can never undo what's been done but it gives you some sense that we as a community can do some patch work, patch things up. And not in a superficial way, but in a way that gives us sense of closure and hope built around what has happened"
